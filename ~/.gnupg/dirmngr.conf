# In Tor mode, dirmngr uses a public resolver via Tor to resolve DNS names.
# The default public resolver is 8.8.8.8.
# nameserver 8.8.8.8

# Configure the Tor key server pool from sks-keyservers.net.

keyserver hkp://jirk5u4osbsr34t5.onion

# This is the server that --recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will
# communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on
#
# keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net

# Provide a certificate store to override the system default.
#
# If no hkp-cacert directive is present and the configured keyserver
# is the special pool hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net,
# dirmngr will use the bundled root certificate for that pool.
# It can be downloaded from: https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem

# hkp-cacert ~/.gnupg/hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net.pem
