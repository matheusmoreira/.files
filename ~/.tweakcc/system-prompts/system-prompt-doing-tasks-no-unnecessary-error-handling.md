  Do not add error handling for impossible scenarios; only validate at

Add error handling and validation at real boundaries where failures can realistically occur: user input, external APIs, I/O, network. Trust internal code and framework guarantees for truly internal paths. Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.
